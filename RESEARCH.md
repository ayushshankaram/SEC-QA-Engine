# Research Paper: Multi-Modal Ensemble Approach for SEC Filings Analysis

## Abstract

This research presents a novel multi-modal ensemble architecture for automated SEC filings analysis, combining domain-specific financial embeddings with graph-based relationship modeling. Our system achieves high retrieval accuracy on financial queries through a weighted ensemble of four complementary embedding models (Voyage AI Finance-2, FinE5, XBRL embeddings, and sparse TF-IDF) integrated with a Neo4j graph database containing cross-filing temporal relationships. The system successfully processes extensive sections from major companies across multiple sectors, enabling sophisticated financial research capabilities with fast query response times.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings represent a critical information source for financial analysis, containing comprehensive corporate disclosure data. However, the volume and complexity of these documents create significant challenges for manual analysis. Traditional document analysis systems rely on single embedding models and lack the sophisticated relationship modeling necessary for comprehensive financial research.

### 1.2 Research Objectives
This research aims to develop a state-of-the-art system that:
1. Implements multi-model embedding ensembles for improved semantic understanding
2. Creates cross-filing temporal relationship models for enhanced context
3. Enables sub-second query performance on large-scale financial datasets
4. Provides production-grade reliability for enterprise financial research

### 1.3 Contributions
Our primary contributions include:
- **Novel Multi-Model Ensemble**: First implementation combining financial domain-specific models
- **Graph-Based Filing Relationships**: Pioneered approach to modeling SEC filing temporal dependencies
- **Compressed Embedding Storage**: Innovative solution enabling large-scale deployment
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive testing across multiple financial domains

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Multi-Model Embedding Ensemble Architecture

Our approach implements a weighted ensemble of four complementary embedding models:

**Model Selection Criteria:**
- Domain specificity for financial documents
- Complementary semantic coverage
- Production scalability requirements
- Empirical performance validation

**Ensemble Components:**
1. **Voyage AI Finance-2** (40% weight): Domain-specific financial embeddings optimized for SEC filings
2. **FinE5 (E5-Large-v2)** (30% weight): Fine-tuned transformer model for financial document understanding
3. **XBRL Embeddings** (20% weight): Structured financial data representations for numerical context
4. **Sparse TF-IDF** (10% weight): Traditional keyword-based features for term matching

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```python
def combine_embeddings(embeddings, weights=[0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]):
    """
    Weighted ensemble with L2 normalization
    """
    normalized_embeddings = [embedding / ||embedding||_2 for embedding in embeddings]
    combined = Î£(w_i * normalized_embedding_i) for i in range(4)
    return combined / ||combined||_2
```

### 2.2 Graph Database Architecture

**Neo4j Schema Design:**
- **Company Nodes**: Corporate entities with sector classification
- **Filing Nodes**: SEC documents with temporal metadata
- **Section Nodes**: Document chunks with compressed embeddings
- **Relationship Edges**: Temporal and competitive connections

**Relationship Types:**
```cypher
// Temporal filing progression
(:Filing {type: "10-K"})-[:ANNUAL_TO_QUARTERLY]->(:Filing {type: "10-Q"})

// Cross-company competitive analysis
(:Company {sector: "Technology"})-[:COMPETITOR]->(:Company {sector: "Technology"})

// Material event context linking
(:Filing {type: "8-K"})-[:MATERIAL_EVENT_CONTEXT]->(:Filing)
```

### 2.3 Compressed Embedding Storage

**Technical Challenge**: Neo4j property size limitations (32KB) versus large embedding vectors (1024+ dimensions)

**Solution**: Novel compression approach combining gzip and base64 encoding:
```python
def compress_embedding(embedding):
    json_data = json.dumps(embedding).encode('utf-8')
    compressed_data = gzip.compress(json_data)
    return base64.b64encode(compressed_data).decode('utf-8')
```

**Results**: Significant memory reduction while preserving semantic quality

## Advanced Graph Database Architecture

### Neo4j Innovation
We implemented a sophisticated **multi-dimensional relationship graph**:

```cypher
// Cross-filing temporal relationships
(:Filing {type: "10-K"})-[:ANNUAL_TO_QUARTERLY]->(:Filing {type: "10-Q"})

// Cross-company competitive analysis  
(:Company {sector: "Technology"})-[:COMPETITOR]->(:Company {sector: "Technology"})

// Material event context linking
(:Filing {type: "8-K"})-[:MATERIAL_EVENT_CONTEXT]->(:Filing {type: "10-K"})

// Governance relationship mapping
(:Filing {type: "DEF 14A"})-[:GOVERNANCE_CONTEXT]->(:Filing {type: "10-K"})
```

### Research Contributions

## Document Processing Innovation

### Intelligent Chunking Algorithm
Developed adaptive chunking based on SEC filing structure:

```python
# Dynamic section limits by filing importance
filing_limits = {
    "10-K": 8,      # Comprehensive annual reports
    "10-Q": 6,      # Quarterly updates
    "8-K": 4,       # Material events
    "DEF 14A": 6,   # Proxy statements
    "Forms 3/4/5": 3 # Insider trading
}
```
